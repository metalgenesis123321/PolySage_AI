    "response": "Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can buy and sell shares on the outcomes of real-world events, with share prices reflecting the market's collective probability assessment of those outcomes. Users purchase \"Yes\" or \"No\" shares for specific events (like election results or economic indicators), and shares pay out $1 if the prediction is correct or $0 if wrong, creating market-driven probability estimates. The platform operates on the Polygon blockchain using USDC stablecoin, with markets resolving based on objective, verifiable outcomes determined by UMA's oracle system."
